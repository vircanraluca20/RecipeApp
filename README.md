The Recipe Web Application, an online platform facilitating users to post, search, and explore culinary recipes, comprises both frontend and backend components. Utilizing Vue.js for the frontend and Node.js along with Express for the backend, a RESTful API is created to enable seamless communication between the user interface and server. Through this application, users have the capability to establish and manage personal accounts, upload new recipes, and conduct searches based on diverse criteria such as ingredients or dish type. 
Consequently, this application presents a convenient and proficient avenue for discovering and disseminating culinary inspirations.
